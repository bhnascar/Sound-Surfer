## Building
This project was built with [openFrameworks](http://openframeworks.cc/download/). To compile and run, first download and extract the zip, and drop the project folder into the apps/myApps directory of your openFrameworks SDK.
Then open soundSurfer.xcodeproj and hit the run button. Everything that's needed is included and the project should compile without problems.
